## Exercise 2
#Printing the string to indicate the value of a
print("a=8")
#Printing the string to indicate the value of b
print("b=10")
a=8           #Variable a is assigned as the value of 8
b=10          #Variable b is assigned as the value of 10
#Calculating the sum of variables a and b
sum = a+b     #Add a and b together
#Printing the sum according to the values of a and b
print("The sum of two numbers is", sum) #The comma is used to separate the text and the variable sum.
